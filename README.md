[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/iwittkau/minio-keygen)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/iwittkau/minio-keygen)

This is a simple [MinIO](https://min.io) Access and Secret Key generator.

# Why?

Minio stopped auto-generating these secrets, so I wrote this little tool.

# Security

The generator is very simple, any security flaw should be obvious. If you have any concerns, please open an issue.

This generator uses Go's `crypto/rand` which implements a cryptographically secure random number generator.

# Installation

```
cd ~
GO111MODULE=on
go get -u github.com/iwittkau/minio-keygen
```

# Usage

```
$ minio-keygen
MINIO_ACCESS_KEY=N0SDCYA4JFCBOI9BDAI4APXB
MINIO_SECRET_KEY=MU3QVVSuHHU2fRHaltxZwH2PQwi4TID38br0vVDY1GaqcJQs
```

You can also create an `.env` file from the output with:

```
$ minio-keygen > .env
```
